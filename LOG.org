** Resume TOML
- After working with a few YAML components, I quickly remembered why TOML has become popular
- Created ~components/toml~ for the various sections of the JSON/TOML documents
- Created ~json2toml.py~, ~toml2json.py~, and ~build_toml.py~ for converting document formats & assembling components

** Changing Focus from Database to Python Script
- For now, building a database for a single JSON file seems like overkill
- Now that I have a sample JSON file, I will simply construct ~resume.json~ in Python
** Resume Object Model
- ~models/resume~ contains a variety of resume sections
