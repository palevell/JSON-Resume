Exclusively ERP Project Highlights
----------------------------------

   Custom extensions or modifications on JD Edwards OneWorld Xe include
   the following:

-  *Job Master Inquiry* – a management tool in JD Edwards, summarizing
      customer account and project information in credit, sales,
      finance, engineering, and manufacturing systems, improving
      documentation and communication between departments; Created a
      user manual and 25-minute training video for this application
      using SnagIt, MS Publisher, and MS PowerPoint

-  *Production Scheduler* – fixed sales, purchasing, manufacturing,
      delivery date issues; linked to Job Master Inquiry and Drafting
      Input; resulting in fewer problems between Sales and Drafting
      *Completed, Not Shipped (CNS)* - the Finished Goods report - every
      nut & bolt in the plant is processed by this custom JD Edwards
      report—a critical piece of Vulcraft’s month-end closing
      procedures; the Controller was using five other reports to get
      this information until CNS was fixed; month-end closing time was
      reduced by at least 20%; this report became an integral part of
      testing system changes in JD Edwards

-  *Material Resource Planning (MRP)* - troubleshooting, modifying, and
      performance-enhancing on this suite of batch applications, to
      reconcile sales, purchasing, manufacturing, and shipping dates,
      and reduce execution time & system resource requirements, as this
      is a *resource* hog

-  *The “Havens” Report* – a custom management report in JD Edwards,
      providing in-depth credit analysis of large and/or problematic
      customer accounts, with two sections—one for the customer, and one
      for top-level management

-  *180-Day Weighted Average* – a custom financial report in JD Edwards
      for calculating customer credit scores, based on their last six
      months of credit history

-  *Over 40 Days* – a custom financial report in JD Edwards for
      identifying overdue accounts

-  *Deck Inventory* – a custom JD Edwards financial (MRP) report for the
      Controller and Purchasing Agent, detailing current and projected
      raw material requirements

-  *Fab Schedule* – the weekly production schedule from which most
      office activity stems; two specialized versions of this report
      created for Drafting and Shop Order; ties in to Manufacturing,
      Customer Service, Job Master, Drafting, and Shop Order Inquiry
      screens

-  *Drafting Inquiry* – added additional fields for tracking approval
      drawings, and signaling Production Scheduler whether drawings are
      in-process, out for approval, or back from approval; linked to the
      Job Master Inquiry and Shop Order Inquiry screens; resulting in
      providing Production Scheduler with up-to-the minute information
      for scheduling purposes

-  *Shop Order Inquiry* – added additional fields for tracking bills of
      materials (aka. shop orders) through the engineering design
      program (outside of JD Edwards); linked to Job Master Inquiry and
      Drafting Inquiry screens; resulting in much improved traceability
      and fewer interruptions in Data Entry from Drafting and Shop
      Order, asking for information

-  *Shipping Inquiry* – a management tool in JD Edwards combining bill
      of lading, sales, and shipping data for much improved reachability

-  *Daily Shipments* – a key custom JDE financial report used for
      invoicing, reported tons & dollars

-  *SO – SF Compare* – a custom JDE application for comparing what was
      sold to what was built & shipped; used primarily on large jobs to
      show the dollar amount left to be invoiced

-  *Re-price Program* – a custom JDE application for re-pricing jobs,
      typically used when design requirements change

Custom Application Highlights
-----------------------------

   Custom development using MS Excel/Access/.Net include the following:

-  *Internal Audit Manager* – a custom MS Access database application
      for managing internal audits of quality and environmental
      management systems; generates checklists, audit questions, and
      audit reports

-  *Inventory Tracking System* – a custom MS Excel spreadsheet
      application to analyze supplier promised & actual delivery dates
      using data from inventory and cost of quality spreadsheets;
      results delivered using charts, graphs, and pivot tables

-  *NUVU BoM Transfer* – a stand-alone application using VB.Net & SQL
      queries to transfer XML data from NUVU bills of materials to the
      engineering design program, effectively getting NUVU (AutoCAD) to
      talk to the design program, written in FORTRAN, and still thinks
      it is running on punch cards; complete with installer and
      auto-update feature for local and satellite sales offices

-  *Shipping Route-out Prototype* – this was a tool to move the current
      delivery dispatches (“route-out”) procedures from paper-based to
      electronic; prototyped in MS Access and later integrated into J.D.
      Edwards

-  *NUVU Installer* – a collection of shell scripts, HTML, and VB.Net
      programs to install NUVU on AutoCAD workstations, including
      network security and administrative shares. All the users had to
      do to install NUVU was click on a single web-link

-  *Joist Input Program* – a front-end to the engineering design
      program, written in VB5 utilizing a SQL Server database instead of
      the old flat-files; object model created using Rational Rose;
      prototyping done in MS Access

Special Projects
----------------

-  Recovered stolen Internet domain name for a Colorado-based real
