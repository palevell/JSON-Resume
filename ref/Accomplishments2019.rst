Exclusively ERP Project Highlights
----------------------------------

Custom extensions or modifications on JD Edwards OneWorld Xe include
the following:

:Job Master Inquiry: A management tool in JD Edwards, summarizing customer account and project information in credit, sales, finance, engineering, and manufacturing systems, improving documentation and communication between departments; Created a user manual and 25-minute training video for this application using SnagIt, MS Publisher, and MS PowerPoint

:Production Scheduler: Fixed sales, purchasing, manufacturing, delivery date issues; linked to Job Master Inquiry and Drafting Input; resulting in fewer problems between Sales and Drafting *Completed, Not Shipped (CNS)* - the Finished Goods report - every nut & bolt in the plant is processed by this custom JD Edwards report—a critical piece of Vulcraft’s month-end closing procedures; the Controller was using five other reports to get this information until CNS was fixed; month-end closing time was reduced by at least 20%; this report became an integral part of testing system changes in JD Edwards

:Material Resource Planning (MRP): Troubleshooting, modifying, and performance-enhancing on this suite of batch applications, to reconcile sales, purchasing, manufacturing, and shipping dates, and reduce execution time & system resource requirements, as this is a *resource* hog

:The “Havens” Report: A custom management report in JD Edwards, providing in-depth credit analysis of large and/or problematic customer accounts, with two sections—one for the customer, and one for top-level management

:180-Day Weighted Average: A custom financial report in JD Edwards for calculating customer credit scores, based on their last six months of credit history

:Over 40 Days: A custom financial report in JD Edwards for identifying overdue accounts

:Deck Inventory: A custom JD Edwards financial (MRP) report for the Controller and Purchasing Agent, detailing current and projected raw material requirements

:Fab Schedule: The weekly production schedule from which most office activity stems; two specialized versions of this report created for Drafting and Shop Order; ties in to Manufacturing, Customer Service, Job Master, Drafting, and Shop Order Inquiry screens

:Drafting Inquiry: Added additional fields for tracking approval drawings, and signaling Production Scheduler whether drawings are in-process, out for approval, or back from approval; linked to the Job Master Inquiry and Shop Order Inquiry screens; resulting in providing Production Scheduler with up-to-the minute information for scheduling purposes

:Shop Order Inquiry: Added additional fields for tracking bills of materials (aka. shop orders) through the engineering design program (outside of JD Edwards); linked to Job Master Inquiry and Drafting Inquiry screens; resulting in much improved traceability and fewer interruptions in Data Entry from Drafting and Shop Order, asking for information

:Shipping Inquiry: A management tool in JD Edwards combining bill of lading, sales, and shipping data for much improved reachability

:Daily Shipments: A  key custom JDE financial report used for invoicing, reported tons & dollars

:SO – SF Compare: A custom JDE application for comparing what was sold to what was built & shipped; used primarily on large jobs to show the dollar amount left to be invoiced

:Re-price Program: A custom JDE application for re-pricing jobs, typically used when design requirements change

Custom Application Highlights
-----------------------------

Custom development using MS Excel/Access/.Net include the following:

:Internal Audit Manager: A custom MS Access database application for managing internal audits of quality and environmental management systems; generates checklists, audit questions, and audit reports

:Inventory Tracking System: A custom MS Excel spreadsheet application to analyze supplier promised & actual delivery dates using data from inventory and cost of quality spreadsheets; results delivered using charts, graphs, and pivot tables

:NUVU BoM Transfer: A stand-alone application using VB.Net & SQL queries to transfer XML data from NUVU bills of materials to the engineering design program, effectively getting NUVU (AutoCAD) to talk to the design program, written in FORTRAN, and still thinks it is running on punch cards; complete with installer and auto-update feature for local and satellite sales offices

:Shipping Route-out Prototype: This was a tool to move the current delivery dispatches (“route-out”) procedures from paper-based to electronic; prototyped in MS Access and later integrated into J.D. Edwards

:NUVU Installer: A collection of shell scripts, HTML, and VB.Net programs to install NUVU on AutoCAD workstations, including network security and administrative shares. All the users had to do to install NUVU was click on a single web-link

:Joist Input Program: A front-end to the engineering design program, written in VB5 utilizing a SQL Server database instead of the old flat-files; object model created using Rational Rose; prototyping done in MS Access
